## Style Guidelines:

- A calm, professional light-scheme palette emphasizing trust and clarity. Primary color (used for accents, interactive elements, and key information): A sophisticated medium blue (#336699). This shade of blue is chosen for its association with stability and intellect, contrasting effectively with a light background.
- The background color: An extremely subtle light blue-grey (#F0F3F5), maintaining cohesion with the primary blue while providing a clean and uncluttered canvas for content.
- Accent color: A fresh, bright aqua (#4DC3C3), providing an analogous contrast to the primary blue. This color will highlight calls-to-action and important notifications, ensuring visibility without overwhelming the primary palette.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a modern sans-serif. Its objective and neutral design ensures high readability for both administrators reviewing detailed records and parents interacting with financial information.
